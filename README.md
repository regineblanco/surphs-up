# SurPH's Up!
SurPH's Up! is a single page web app that serves as a directory for surfers and aficionados on the where to surf, stay, and eat in some famous Philippine surf spots.

My concept of this project came from <a href="http://magicseaweed.com/">Magicseaweed.com</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en">Google Maps</a>, and <a href="https://ph.phonebooky.com/">Booky</a>-- a Philippine-based app directory on where to eat around Metro Manila.

It is also my first time to use MySQL as database.

<h3>How to Use SurPH's Up</h3>

 Viewers can "Just Peep" at the app and click on pinned spots on the Philippine map. After which, they will be able to see a brief description of the spot, its address, pictures, and a list of places under "Surf Spots", "Lodgings", and "Food Finds". They can click on those places, and more description appears about them. As logged in users, they can add and delete places, and edit the description as well.
 
 They can also use Google Maps and all its features inside the app.
